Bug Fix: Intermittent API Timeouts in Production

We observed intermittent 504 Gateway Timeout errors when traffic spikes during peak hours.
Initial investigation showed that the application pods were healthy, but requests were timing out at the load balancer.

Root cause:
The timeout value on the load balancer was lower than the application’s response timeout,
causing long-running requests to be terminated early.

Fix:
Updated the load balancer timeout to align with the application timeout and added basic request latency metrics
so we can detect this earlier next time.

This change is submitted via Pull Request for review to ensure it does not negatively impact performance or cost.
